# Components

This repository uses a component-based architecture to keep features modular. Each component has:

- A dedicated header/source pair (e.g., `calculator.hpp` / `calculator.cpp`).
- Clear responsibilities.
- Corresponding unit tests.

## Current Components

1. **Calculator** – Performs basic arithmetic operations.
2. **Logger** – Records operations and results.
3. **Notifier** – Triggers alerts when a threshold is exceeded.
